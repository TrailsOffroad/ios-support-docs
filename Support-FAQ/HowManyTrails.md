# How many trails do you have?

We have over 2200+ trails in our system and it is growing monthly. 
Our team of writers is out scouting new trails weekly and after a 
thorough review of their guides we publish new trails in batches every 
other week. Follow us on social media to keep up with the latest news. 
The amount of trails varies per state but if you are curious the Offline 
tab will show the number we have per state.
