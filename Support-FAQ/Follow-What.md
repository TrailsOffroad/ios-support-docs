# What does Follow do? 

Follow is a mode where not only does the map center to your current location 
but it also provides you a scrolling list of waypoints that you are approaching. 
Waypoints will scroll as you near them, although it's not perfect since it's distance 
as-the-crow-flies. The list of waypoints is scrollable so you can look-around and when 
you click on the card it will open with pictures (internet connection required) of that 
waypoint as well as a description.
