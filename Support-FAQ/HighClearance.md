# What does High Clearance mean?

High clearance refers to the distance between the ground 
and the underside of your vehicle, also referred to as ground 
clearance. Vehicles with larger tires and taller suspension 
will have more clearance and therefore be able to tackle more 
difficult trails. Please note however just because your vehicle 
**might** have more ground clearance and seem more offroad capable 
please read our guides carefully to Know Before You Go. If you 
are an All-Access subscriber you will have access to our Advanced 
Rating System for extra information about the trail's difficulty.
