# How do I cancel?

We would be very sorry to see you go. If you 
would like to cancel your All-Access membership 
cancellation will depend where you made the purchase 
(website versus app store). All you need to do is 
click the "Manage Subscription" button on the Settings 
tab and it will take you to the right place.

If you do not have a subscription, or you already cancelled
it and would also like us to remove your account and any 
personal data then please send that request via email to 
<a href="mailto:support@trailsoffroad.com">
support@trailsoffroad.com</a>.
