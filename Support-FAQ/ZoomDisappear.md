# Why do trails disappear when zoomed in?

If you have not subscribed to our All-Access 
Membership then unfortunately when zooming in on 
the map you will **some** tracks (our All-Access trails)
disappear. Only an orange marker will remain at the 
start of the trailhead. Upon zooming out the track will
be visible again for a preview.

Us and our writers have worked hard to curate detailed 
content and we can't give every trail away for free! We do 
have some Featured trails, which you will be able to find by 
the colored GPS tracks, that will give you a good sense 
of most of the data you can see as an All-Access member.
