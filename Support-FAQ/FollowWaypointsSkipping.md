# While Following a trail why are waypoints skipping?

When you toggle Follow mode for a trail we use your devices 
GPS location to determine the nearest waypoint to your location. 
This distance to the next waypoint is calculated as-the-crow-flies 
so during switchbacks or similar navigation you may experience a 
jumping between waypoints. We have plans to improve this in 
the future!
