# Can I use the app Offline?

Yes, of course! Before you leave we encourage you to 
download the offline data you will need while still on WiFi. 
Our offline data includes the base maps, the trail track/gpx, 
the trail guide, and waypoints. Everything you would normally 
get while Online minus pictures - that would require a lot of 
space on your device.

To download for offline use, you will need to go to the 
Offline tab (second from right) at the bottom of the screen, 
choose the State you will be traveling to and wait 3-10 mintues 
for it to complete. The average State "offline package" is 
200mb, with Alaska being the very slow outlier of 1.2GB!

There is not a method for downloading individual trails due 
to the need to also download the basemap as well.

Should you need to free space on your device there is a button 
in settings to do so.
