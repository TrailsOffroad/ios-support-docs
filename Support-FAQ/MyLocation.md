# How do I see my current GPS location?

Your current GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude) are available 
by clicking the information (i) icon in the bottom-left of the map. 
The altitude (if available) and accuracy will be shown as well. Good 
for emergencies although we hope you don't need to use it for that!
